Automatically folds all blocks (i.e. { } ) in C and C++ and defines a function that performs a command e.g. zo on all folds beginning with text that matches a given pattern.

This allows for the following mappings defined by the plugin:

      z[ - Opens all doxygen-style comments
      z] - Closes all doxygen-style comments
      z{ - Opens all code blocks (i.e. {  })
      z} - Closes all code blocks
